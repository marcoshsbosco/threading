# Threaded matrices
This program performs algebraic operations on matrices both sequentially and using threading. Since threading in Python is mostly useless for CPU-bound tasks, an example generic method is implemented sequentially and using threads as well which leverages threading by sleeping (waiting) during the method execution.

## Instructions
### Running the program
Open a terminal in the main directory, type `make` and press Enter.
